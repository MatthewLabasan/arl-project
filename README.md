ARL Internship Project

## 6/20/24
Today I finished setting up my environment and got my first node.js server set up with Express.js.
It consists of a basic html file. In my JS file, I set up a get method and allowed my app to listen to requests on port 3000. Today, I also experimented a lot with git
and learned more about coding in javascript. Tomorrow, I want to explore the web scraping side, learn how I can structure my project and backend algorithms, and learn about deployment to a public link.

Instead of starting on web scraping exploration, I decided to go into more depth on setting up my node.js server and understanding the connections between the 
backend and frontned. I learned a lot about middlewear, error handling, and how the server is able to retrieve files. I also learned about cors policy and how to handle that, and the implementation of logs. I'm watching a MERN app tutorial, and am following along on another repo. Chatgpt has been really helpful in explaining concepts that aren't fully touched in the video, but I've also been double checking the documentation alongside it. This weekend, I hope to continue this and go into databases (specifically mongo), and some frontend react stuff. By next week, I should be ready to start looking into web scraping and beginning that process on a server that I build myself. Below is a rough timeline I hope to follow:
    - 6/26: Begin web scrapping exploration
    - 7/3: Finish up web scrapping, work on auto emailing / pdf creation of scrapped data,
    - 7/10: Work on database search functionality 
    - 7/17: Work on frontend/fix bugs
    - 7/24: Work up paper and presentation
