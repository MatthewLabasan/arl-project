ARL Internship Project

## 6/20/24
Today I finished setting up my environment and got my first node.js server set up with Express.js.
It consists of a basic html file. In my JS file, I set up a get method and allowed my app to listen to requests on port 3000. Today, I also experimented a lot with git
and learned more about coding in javascript. Tomorrow, I want to explore the web scraping side, learn how I can structure my project and backend algorithms, and learn about deployment to a public link.
